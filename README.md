# Ray-llm-inference

This is a FastAPI-based inference server for the GPT-J model. It uses Ray and Ray Serve for deployment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the inference server on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python and Ray installed. You can install Ray using pip:


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ray-llm-inference.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd Ray-llm-inference
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the server:

```
python app.py
```

The server will start, and you can make POST requests to the `/generate_text` endpoint to generate text using the GPT-J model.

Example POST request:

```json
{
    "input_text": "Hello, Ionet!"
}
```

### Testing

You can test the inference server by making a POST request to the `/generate_text` endpoint:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate_text", json={"input_text": "Hello, Ionet!"})
print(response.json())
```
